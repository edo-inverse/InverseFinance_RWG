# Inverse Finance's Risk Working Group Repository
This repository is dedicated to the work of the Inverse Finance's Risk Working Group (RWG). From providing ongoing due diligence for new lending opportunities, risk assessment of new liquidity strategies, to managing an increasingly complex and disparate array of DOLA Fed lending facilities, the RWG is an essential arm of Inverse DAO and it's suite of products.

## Contents
The repository contains risk assessments performed on partnering protocols, collateral types for our fixed-rate lending market FiRM and past work done for our now deprecated variable-rate lending market Frontier. The repository also contains past contributions of members of the RWG to Inverse DAO, whether it be due diligence, collaborative work with the Treasury Working Group (TWG) or other working groups, etc.

## Contact
For more information on the work of the RWG or if you're interested in contributing to the work of the RWG, please contact us through the Inverse Finance's Discord. We welcome contributions of all kinds.
